3. Implement a counter for each product that increments by 1 every time the "Buy Now" button is pressed.
4. When the counter for a product reaches 5, show a dialog box with the message "Congratulations! You've bought 5 {Product Name}!" Replace {Product Name} with the    actual name of the product.

6. Implement navigation to a new page called CartPage when the user presses a "Go to Cart" button. 
7. The CartPage should display the total number of products the user has bought.
